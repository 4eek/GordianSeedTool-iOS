This release features signing Partially-Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) and export of output descriptors for interacting with other wallets!

• OS Support: This release supports iOS 15 or later and introduces support for macOS 12 (Monterey) or later.
• Scan view: A camera selector button has been added for front/back cameras (iOS) and built-in/desktop webcam (macOS).
• PSBT Signing: When a `ur:crypto-request` for PSBT signing is scanned, Seed Tool will attempt to find seeds that it is managing from which it can derive keys to sign the transaction's inputs. A confirmation screen is then displayed showing the details of the transaction. If the user approves, a ur:crypto-response is displayed. A "bare" PSBT may
• Bare PSBT Signing: For compatibility with third-party wallets that have already implemented this, a bare `ur:crypto-psbt` may now be scanned and signed. Using `ur:crypto-request` is Blockchain Commons' recommended method for requesting PSBT signing, so when a bare `ur:crypto-psbt` is scanned, users are notified of this, thus this capability should be used only by wallet developers, and they are encourage to adopt `ur:crypto-request` as soon as possible.
• PSBT import formats: Importing a PSBT for signing may be done from the camera for `ur:crypto-request` and `ur:crypto-psbt`, or the clipboard for Base64-encoded PSBTs, or from a file for binary or Base64-encoded `.psbt` files.
• PSBT export formats: Exporting a signed PSBT may be done in several formats: `ur:crypto-response`, `ur:crypto-psbt`, Base64-encoded PSBT, or binary `.psbt` file. All of these formats may use the share sheet, allowing (for example) Copy to Clipboard, *except* for binary `.psbt` files, which must be saved to the file system. The two UR formats can be displayed as (possibly animating) QR codes.
• Key Export via Output Descriptors: Master keys derived from seeds can now be exported to Output Descriptors (`ur:crypto-output` or text) or Account Descriptors (`ur:crypto-account`). To see this new feature:

1. choose a seed from the Seed List
2. In the Encrypted Data section, tap "Authenticate"
3. Tap "Derive Key" and then "Other Key Derivations"
4. In the "Parameters" area, make sure "Bitcoin" and "Master Key" are selected
5. Scroll down to the "Secondary Derivation" section and choose "Output Descriptor" or "Account Descriptor".
6. Edit the "Account Number" field if desired.
7. If you chose "Output Descriptor", then choose an "Output Type".
8. Scroll down to the bottom to export your Output Descriptor or Account Descriptor.

• QR Code Display: To increase compatibility with certain QR code readers, QR codes are now displayed as black modules (pixels) on a white background, even in dark mode.
• Other bug fixes and minor enhancements.
