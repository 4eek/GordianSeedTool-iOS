“Seeds” are long strings of truly random numbers used in cryptography. As the name suggests, seeds are used as the starting point for other things like generating useful objects like keys and addresses used with cryptocurrencies. To be secure, seeds need to be generated and stored safely. Gordian Guardian lets you generate seeds and store them securely in your device's keychain. You can even use an entirely offline device (no Internet access) to store your seeds, and exchange just necessary information with online devices running compatible wallet or signing software using QR codes.

Gordian Guardian lets you derive and share multi-signature signing and verification keys from your seeds, and lets you back up your seeds in sophisticated ways, including printed pages and Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction (SSKR), which lets you split your seed into pieces and send them to trusted parties, who can send them back to you in an emergency, allowing you to recover your seed.

Gordian Guardian is open source software from Blockchain Commons, a not-for-profit public good organization. Find our repository on GitHub and check out the code for yourself!
