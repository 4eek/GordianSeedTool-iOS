# What is Gordian Envelope?

Gordian Envelope is a way of structuring and tranmitting “smart documents”. It is very flexible, and can be used for smaller documents like the cryptographic seeds that SeedTool manages, or much larger and complex documents. It enables variety of features including encryption, signing, and holder-based elision, which is a privacy protection feature.

Whatever their content, when conveyed as as a UR you'll always see envelopes start with `ur:envelope`.

SeedTool uses Gordian Envelope to export and import seeds and SSKR shares for seed backup, and to export HD keys.
