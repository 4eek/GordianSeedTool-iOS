## Installation Instructions

**Gordian Seed Tool** is available from the [Apple Appstore for the iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229), or can be compiled from source here.

To compile from source, simply choose "Code > Open with Xcode" from the top of the repo. This will download the code into Xcode, including all of the dependencies. After you will be able to _Run_ (command-R) it for your Mac or a connected iOS device.

## Usage Instructions

## Gordian Principles

**Gordian Seed Tool** is a reference implementation meant to display the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles), which are philosophical and technical underpinnings to Blockchain Commons' Gordian technology. This includes:

* **Independence.** Seed Tool allows you to maintain personal control of your cryptographic key material.
* **Privacy.** Seed Tool ensures your privacy because everything is on your closely held mobile device.
* **Resilience.** Seed Tool uses 2FA by combining an Apple login with biometric authentication. It securely backs up your material to iCloud.
* **Openness.** Cosigner communicates through airgaps via URs and QRs, for maximum interoperability.

Blockchain Commons apps do not phone home and do not run ads. Some are available through various app stores; all are available in our code repositories for your usage.

# Status - Released (1.1)

**Gordian Seedtool** has been released through the [Apple Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229).

## Version History

### 1.2 (26), July 28, 2021

* In the Export SSKR display, removed export individual shares views. Since the SSKR generated is ephemeral, it wasn't really useful to conditionally show each one. You can now only share or print all the generated shares at once.
* The last preset in the SSKR export display is now called, "2 of 3 shares, of two of three groups".
* In the Derive Key view, both the private and public keys are now simulatenously derived, so a separate parameter for Key Type (i.e., private or public) is no longer necessary.
* In the Derive Key view, selecting Ethereum as the asset type now only allows master key derivations.
* In the Derive Key view, the share buttons for the derived public and private keys are no longer popup menus: they take you directly the the Key Export view, which shows all the export options including the QR code, print button, share as Base58. If Developer Functions are turned on in Settings, then buttons to show sample requests and responses are also visible here.
* The Share as Base58 function in the Key Export view now includes the master key fingerprint and derivation path along with the Base-58 key.

### 1.2 (25), July 27, 2021

This is a preview testing release of what will become version 1.2. It does not yet include the full set of planned features to be release with 1.2.

* You can now navigate from various places of the app to specific pages of the built-in user's guide via the ⓘ buttons.
* The Settings panel now contains a Show Developer Functions switch that shows the "Show Request/Response for this Seed/Key" options at appropriate places in the app.
* All functions that copied data to the clipboard, including long presses on QR codes, life hashes, and other static fields, now invoke the system share sheet instead. The downside to this is that the "Copy" function in the share sheet does not automatically expire the clipboard contents after a minute. It *might* be possible to add this as an app-specific function in the share sheet.
* In the Seed Detail view, the "Data" section has been renamed "Encrypted Data", and the "Decrypt" button is now called "Authenticate". It now reveals several buttons: Backup, Share, and Derive Key, which are menus that lead to futher functionality. There are also links to the documentation. This was done to make the many functions that authentication reveals more discoverable and intuitive. 
* The SSKR export view now includes a "preset selector" that lets users choose among comon sharding configurations. Users can still choose any configuration they like and this will be reflected in the preset selector as "custom".
* The "Next" button in the SSKR Export view has been moved from the bottom of the form to the top right of the view.
* All "Done" buttons are now consistently in the upper-right corner of their views.
* In the Settings panel, the default network is now "mainnet". This will only apply to users who have not manually changed this setting. 
* "Allows Further Derivation" has been removed from Key Export parameters, as it's an advanced feature not likely to be used by many users, and leaving it in was causing confusion.
* Fixed: Text in SSKR heads-up display in Scan View should always be white. Currently it is black when the phone is not in Dark Mode.

### 1.1 (24), July 13, 2021

* More detailed diagnostic messages when pasting SSKR fails.
* Scan view can now pick image(s) from document picker or photos picker.
* Added textual UR to Seed, HDKey, and SSKR print pages.

### 1.0.1 (23), July 7, 2021

* Added support on the macOS version for Print to PDF.

### 1.0.1 (22), July 7, 2021

* Fixed issues [#59](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/issues/59), [#60](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/issues/60), [#62](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/issues/62)
