**Gordian Seed Tool** protects your cryptographic seeds while also making them available for easy use. Using Seed Tool, you can generate seeds and store them securely on your device. You can then derive and share multi-signature signing and verification keys from those seeds. Sophisticated backup procedures include printed pages and Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction ([SSKR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/README.md#sharded-secret-key-reconstruction-sskr)) â€” which lets you split your seed into pieces and send them to trusted parties, who can send them back to you in an emergency for seed recovery. You can even use an entirely offline device (no internet access) to store your seeds and use QR codes to exchange necessary information with online devices running compatible wallet or signing software.

## Gordian Principles

**Gordian Seed Tool** is a reference implementation meant to display the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles), which are philosophical and technical underpinnings to Blockchain Commons' Gordian technology. This includes:

* **Independence.** Seed Tool allows you to maintain personal control of your cryptographic key material.
* **Privacy.** Seed Tool ensures your privacy because everything is on your closely held mobile device.
* **Resilience.** Seed Tool uses 2FA by combining an Apple login with biometric authentication. It securely backs up your material to iCloud.
* **Openness.** Seed Tool communicates through airgaps via URs and QRs, for maximum interoperability.

Blockchain Commons apps do not phone home and do not run ads. Some are available through various app stores; all are available in our code repositories for your usage.

# Status - Released (1.5)

**Gordian Seed Tool** has been released through the [Apple Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229).

## Version History

[Join the Test Flight Open Beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/0LIl6H1h)

### 1.6 (73)

* Printing a seed: the Envelope will elide the seed name if it's longer than 100 characters and will elide the notes if they're longer than 500 characters.

### 1.6 (72)

* SeedTool now exports the version 3 `ur:output-descriptor` (#6.40308) type, as documented in [BCR-2023-010](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-010-output-descriptor.md).
* SeedTool now exports version 2 CBOR tags for several structures, while maintaining backwards-compatibility with version 1 CBOR tags. So instead of exporting `ur:crypto-seed` (#6.300), SeedTool now exports `ur:seed` (#6.40300), while still being able to import `ur:crypto-seed`. This also applies to `ur:crypto-sskr` (#6.303) which is now `ur:sskr` (#6.40303) and `ur:crypto-hdkey` (#6.303) which is now `ur:hdkey` (#6.40303).

### 1.6 (71)

* The bottom of the Seed Detail screen has a new feature that lets a seed be associated with a primary output descriptor. The output descriptor may be pasted in its textual form or as a Gordian Envelope containing an output descriptor per [BCR-2023-007](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-007-envelope-output-desc.md)
* The associated output descriptor is persisted with the seed and exported with the seed's Gordian Envelope.
* The associated output descriptor *must* be derived from the seed to which it is associated. Attempting to assocate an otherwise valid output descriptor not derived from the seed presents a specific error message.
* The envelope format of output descriptors can contain optional name and notes fields, and these are displayed by SeedTool for the associated output descriptor if present, but they are not currently editable.
* A seed's Envelope Notation is now hidden unless "Show Developer Functions" is turned on in the app Settings. When visible it is at the very bottom of the Seed Detail screen. The envelope notation shows any attachments or output descriptor associated with the seed, but does not reveal the seed itself.
* You can now long-press on a seed's Envelope Notation to share it.
* The "Clear" button for a seed's Creation Date and Output Descriptor fields now present confirmation alerts before clearing them.
* When using `Seed Detail > Authenticate > Derive Key > Other Key Derivations > Output Descriptor` the default export format is stil `ur:crypto-output` for compatibility, but a new button has been added to allow export as Gordian Envelope. 

### 1.6 (70)

* The app now stores third-party attachments to seeds. See [BCR-2023-006](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-006-envelope-attachment.md)
* Displays Envelope Notation for seed (including any attachments) at bottom of Seed Detail view.
* Seed Envelope export now includes any attachments.
* Seed Envelope import now restores attachments.
* SSKR using envelopes now backs up seeds including attachments.
* Scan now support Seed and SSKR Envelopes that include attachments.
* NOTE: Printed backup seeds do *not* include attachments due to the fact that attachments can be arbitrarily large.
* `Add Seed > SSKR` now accepts a list of SSKR Envelopes, one per line.    

### 1.6 (69)

* Fixed #199 Large SSKR Envelopes Overflow Print Page. When printed, SSKR Envelopes requiring more than 50 bytewords only show the last four bytewords.
* Updated the Envelope library to use the latest version. This is a breaking change, hopefully the last!
* All examples in the source repo Testing folder have been updated for compatibility.

### 1.6 (68)

* For seeds and HDKeys, wherever the master public key fingerprint is shown, it is now accompanied by a small LifeHash that matches the one displayed in SparrowWallet.
* Fixed #191 Bytewords SSKR Doesn't Work in Add Seed.
* Fixed #194 BIP39 mnemonics can now be decoded where words have been abbreviated to the first four letters.
* Fixed #197 NFC Write: Tag Not Connected

### 1.6 (67)

* SSKR backup now offers the option of exporting as Gordian Envelope or the legacy `ur:crypto-sskr` format with Envelope being the default. The major advantage of the new format is that it backs up all the seed's metadata (named, notes, creation date, etc.) and not just the raw key bytes. `ur:crypto-sskr` is still accepted for recovery.
* As Envelopes may be arbitrary size, when printing SSKR shares the option to put multiple shares as "coupons" on a single page has been removed.
* Seeds are now exported and imported as Gordian Envelope. `ur:crypto-seed` is still accepted for importing.
* Keys are now exported as Gordian Envelope. `ur:crypto-hdkey` is discontinued.
* All requests and responses are now formatted as Gordian Envelope. `ur:crypto-psbt` is still accepted for signing and may still be exported as the result of a signing request.
* Output descriptors are still exported as `ur:crypto-output`.
* Account descriptors are still exported as `ur:crypto-account`.
* Example seeds, PSBTs, and requests in the `Testing` folder have been updated to the new preferred formats.

### 1.6 (66)

* Fixed bug with CBOR serialization of master private keys and the public "master" keys directly derived from them (Issue #182).
* Clarified documentation (BCR-2020-007) for how we're representing pair-components in output descriptors (Issue #183).

### 1.6 (65)

Interim release.

### 1.6 (64)

Interim release (iOS only).

### 1.6 (63)

Interim release.

### 1.6 (62)

* Envelope format has changed, so the app has been updated to use the latest format for requests and responses.

### 1.6 (61)

* Requests and responses are now all based on the Envelope type.

### 1.6 (60)

* Now responds to crypto-request for an output descriptor. This will allow the upcoming Gordian Coordinator or other wallet apps to securely request an output descriptor for use in online wallets.
* Numerous other small changes and improvements throughout the app.
* A lot of code has been moved to where it can be shared between all Gordian apps, particularly the upcoming Gordian Coordinator. As such, this should be considered an *early* beta and all functionality should be thoroughly re-tested.

### Summary of changes in version 1.5 (May 11, 2022)

* [Save individual SSKR shares as PDFs (using printing)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/MANUAL.md#exporting-the-shares).

General bug fixes and improvements.

### Summary of changes in version 1.4 (April 6, 2022)

#### I/O Improvements

* NFC Import: Allows import from NFC Tags.
* UR Import: Imports and processes "ur:" scheme strings.
* Clipboard Erasure: Erases clipboard in 1 minute when used for export (iOS only).
* File Saving: Exports to files, including MicroSDs and iCloud.
* SSKR Split: Allows individual export of SSKR shares, such as to different MicroSD cards.

#### New Data Details

* Descriptor Checksums: All output descriptors now include their checksum.
* Seed Fingerprints: All seed OIBs now display the fingerprint for their master HD key.
* Request Details: All crypto-requests now show notes and known key derivations.

#### Other Updates & Fixes

* Seed Request Fix: Parses crypto-requests for seeds using the latest spec.
* Other: Various UX improvements, interface standardizations, and small bug fixes.

### 1.4 (56)

* Fixed crash on Mac when exporting keys.

### 1.4 (55)

* #152 In the Seed Detail screen, the "Randomize" and "Clear Field" buttons that appear in the Seed Name field when editing it have been replaced with a menu button that includes "Randomize" and "Clear" commands, that only appears when the field is *not* being edited. This is to reduce the chance of the user accidentally changing the field.
* #114 When responding to a request for a key derivation that asks the user to select a seed, the pre-seed selection screen now shows information about the derivation path, as well as any note included with the request. This is in addition to showing this information on the request approval screen.
* The parsing for requests and responses was using an outdated format. The seed requests and responses now conform to the latest spec. The Seed Request QR in the Testing folder in the repo has also been updated.
* A crash at startup was observed when the most recent builds are run on an iPod Touch running iOS 15.3.1. Based on crash logs, I determined that this is because the CoreNFC framework is missing on the iPod Touch, causing a dynamic link failure at startup. This issue has been [reported by other developers](http://www.openradar.me/FB9836080) and according to this report an iPod Touch running iOS 15.1 does not crash. As I do not have an iPod Touch to test on, the only thing I was able to do in the next build was to set the CoreNFC framework to "weak link." This may avoid the immediate crash at startup, but the app may still crash in places where it attempts to call into CoreNFC. Further crash logs for this build need to be examined to see whether anything further can be done about this. 

### 1.4 (54)

* Seed Tool now shows any associated note attached to requests for seeds or keys. It displays the note text in a distinctive style and warns the user to be careful about whether to trust what the note contains. To facilitate testing this, the "Show Example Request..." functions now include a dummy note.
* #114 When responding to Key Requests, Seed Tool now shows the requested derivation path's known name, if it corresponds to one, or a warning if it does not.
* #143 When long-pressing on the various parts of an Object Identity Block (OIB), and then choosing the Save to Files... option, suggested filenames are now consistent with the identified subject as well as the selected field of the OIB (LifeHash, Identifier, Detail, and Name). All suggested filenames for objects derived from seeds (such as HDKeys and Addresses) now start with the Seed Digest Identifier first and then the Digest Identifier of the derived object. 
* #145 Added checksums to all Output Descriptors exported as text, as well as the filenames used with Save to File for descriptors.
* #147 Fixed crash when Scan view is invoked with camera permissions revoked in Settings > Privacy > Camera > Seed Tool.
* #148 Fixed so all Key Export views have the same export options, including Base58.
