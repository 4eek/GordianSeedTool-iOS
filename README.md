## Status - Late Alpha

`Gordian Guardian` is currently under active development and in the late alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.

### Roadmap

## Version History

### 1.0 (6), January 30, 2021

* Fixed a crashing bug found just after the previous release, which happened when saving a newly-created seed.

### 1.0 (5), January 30, 2021

#### General

* A UI bar now appears over the main screen with Blockchain Commons branding and a `gear` button that opens the global settings page.
    * The "Info" button that appears does not currently have any content.
    * Currently the only setting available is "Default Network." This affects the `Seed Detail > Gordian Public Key` button and the default Parameters of the `Derive and Export Key` function.
* Button hit boxes now bigger and easier to press.
* The Blockchain Commons logo is now available for use throughtout the app as a custom SF Symbols glyph.

#### Seed Detail

* A prominent button now allows immediate export of the Gordian Public Key derived from the seed's master key [48'/0'/0'/2']. If The Default Network setting is `testnet` then the derived path is [48'/1'/0'/2'].
* The key export menu has been re-arranged to make expected more common tasks appear closer to where the user taps to show the menu.

#### Key Export

* A problem with the base58 export of the derived key not matching other tools and libraries was fixed.
* The Parameters section is set for Gordian Key defaults.
* The Network parameter will match the Default Network setting of the Settings Panel.
* The Derived Key path is displayed like this now: `[314a3f16/48'/1'/0'/2'] ➜ a1e1c73d`. This makes it clear which master key was used, and that the derived key was the result of deriving the path shown.

#### Known issues

* The on-screen keyboard is likely to cover the Notes field when it is tapped into, forcing the user to scroll down to it after the keyboard appears. This is a bug in SwiftUI and Apple may fix it or we may figure out a workaround at a later date.

### 1.0 (4), January 27, 2021

* Fixed abort in release build.

### 1.0 (3), January 27, 2021

* App name has changed to "Guardian" and the app icon has been updated.
* `Seed Detail > Unlock > Derive and Export Key` has been added that allows several different parameters to be set for the key derivation, and the derived key itself to be exported to either ur:crypto-hdkey (as QR code or to the clipboard) or copied to the clipboard as Base58 
* `Seed Detail`: Increased size of clear field button, and moved random name button to left of clear field button for consistency with other fields.
* Add `Seed > Import SSKR` now allows you to paste in shares as either ByteWords or ur:crypto-sskr. You can paste the entire output of  `Seed Detail > Unlock > Export as SSKR Multi-Share` including explanatory text, which will be ignored.
* `Seed Detail > Unlock > Export as ur:crypto-seed` now handles exporting as either a QR code or copying the ur:crypto-seed to the clipboard. There is no longer a separate command in the Export menu to copy the ur:crypto-seed.
* All app model types (Seed and Key) as well as all import and export formats (e.g., Hex, BIP39 SSKR, UR:, etc.) all now have unique custom icons.

### 1.0 (2), January 19, 2021

* Switched to using `.version2` LifeHashes.
* All buttons that reveal or export sensitive information are now coded yellow.
* Seed detail screens now have a lock icon that when tapped triggers local authentication (FaceID, TouchID, or Passcode) before revealing the seed data and the menu that allows export of the seed in various forms.
* Seed Creation Date ("birthdate") is now supported. Newly generated seeds have the current date as their creation date. The creation date can be modified or removed via the Seed Detail view.
* Most static information is now copyable to the clipboard via a long press. Includes: LifeHash images, seed fingerprint (not data, just the hash of the data), seed name, seed data, SSKR shares, QR codes.
* All copy operations now provide haptic feedback.
* Fixed some cosmetic issues.
    * Padding around seed detail when keyboard present.
    * Size text in seed Name field.
	
### 1.0 (1), December 24, 2020

* First TestFlight Release

### Dependencies

To build  `Gordian Guardian` you'll need to use the following tools:

- Xtools with Swift (or another Swift compiler)

### Derived from....

`Gordian Guardian` incorporates:
 * [BCLibsSwift](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCLibsSwift) and thus a variety of [crypto commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/README.md) libraries.

### Related to...

Blockchain Commons has two other seedtools:

* [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) — Our DIY hardware project contains a seedtool.
* [seedtool-cli](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli) — Seedtool-cli is a command-line version of seedtool.

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.
