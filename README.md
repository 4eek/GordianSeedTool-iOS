## Status - Late Alpha

`Fehu` is currently under active development and in the late alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.

### Roadmap

## Version History

### 1.0 (2), January 19, 2021

#### Fixes and Enhancements

* Switched to using `.version2` LifeHashes.
* All buttons that reveal or export sensitive information are now coded yellow.
* Seed detail screens now have a lock icon that when tapped triggers local authentication (FaceID, TouchID, or Passcode) before revealing the seed data and the menu that allows export of the seed in various forms.
* Seed Creation Date ("birthdate") is now supported. Newly generated seeds have the current date as their creation date. The creation date can be modified or removed via the Seed Detail view.
* Most static information is now copyable to the clipboard via a long press. Includes: LifeHash images, seed fingerprint (not data, just the hash of the data), seed name, seed data, SSKR shares, QR codes.
* All copy operations now provide haptic feedback.
* Fixed some cosmetic issues.
	* Padding around seed detail when keyboard present.
	* Size text in seed Name field.

#### Known issues

* The on-screen keyboard is likely to cover the Notes field when it is tapped into, forcing the user to scroll down to it after the keyboard appears. This is a bug in SwiftUI and Apple may fix it or we may figure out a workaround at a later date.
	
### 1.0 (1), December 24, 2020

* First TestFlight Release

### Dependencies

To build  `Fehu` you'll need to use the following tools:

- Xtools with Swift (or another Swift compiler)

### Derived from....

`Fehu` incorporates:
 * [BCLibsSwift](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCLibsSwift) and thus a variety of [crypto commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/README.md) libraries.

### Related to...

Blockchain Commons has two other seedtools:

* [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) — Our DIY hardware project contains a seedtool.
* [seedtool-cli](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli) — Seedtool-cli is a command-line version of seedtool.

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.

### Other Questions & Problems

As an open-source, open-development community, Blockchain Commons does not have the resources to provide direct support of our projects. Please consider the discussions area as a locale where you might get answers to questions. Alternatively, please use this repository's [issues](./issues) feature. Unfortunately, we can not make any promises on response time.

If your company requires support to use our projects, please feel free to contact us directly about options. We may be able to offer you a contract for support from one of our contributors, or we might be able to point you to another entity who can offer the contractual support that you need.
